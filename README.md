# RfWK

RfWK is an iOS app that serves as a companion app to those who study Japanese with the help of WaniKani [1].

WaniKani’s spaced repetition system and mnemonics are a great aid in recalling the meaning of a Japanese word.

However, when translating to Japanese, these aids might prove less effective, since you cannot recall the mnemonics from looking at individual kanji when you are asking yourself “what is _reservation_ in Japanese again?”

Practice the reverse direction with RfWK. RfWK is short for _Reverse for WaniKani_.

Features:
- Connect your WaniKani.com account and work with the study materials you are already familiar with
- Browse through kanji, vocabulary and meanings
- Find different vocabulary that share the same reading
- Practice translating to Japanese and answer in Romaji or Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji when using a Japanese language keyboard
- Refresh your account to fetch newly available study materials as you make progress on WaniKani

A WaniKani account is required to use RfWK.

## Is the app in the iOS App Store?

No, this app is currently not available for download in Apple’s iOS App Store.

This is due to the app relying on the WaniKani service which does offer premium content and me – not being affiliated with WaniKani or Tofugu LLC – unable to offer In-App-Purchases to access those premium contents since this is not possible via WaniKani’s [API](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/) on which RfWK is built.
